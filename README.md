# ResearchProject

This is the git repo for my MRes CMEE project. 

The Code directory contains all of my code (working code & testfiles). 

The WriteUp directory will contain the notes from relevant papers, notes for my dissertation, and my dissertation code. 

The WorkLog directory contains short textfiles that I write up throughout the week. In these I keep brief notes detailing 
the work that I have done every day. 

The Proposal directory contains my (finished) project proposal. 

There are several directories that are NOT stored in github, as they are too large. These are backed up in "Box", which I update 2/3 times a week. 

These directories are:

Readings - a list of useful papers, vignettes, and package documentation. 

Data - species lists and tables, phylogenetic information, etc etc. HUGE file!
