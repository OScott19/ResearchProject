	\section{Introduction}
	\noindent

\subsection{The need for conservation efforts }
Our planet is currently losing species at such a significant rate that this 
period has been called the "Sixth mass extinction" 
\autocite{Barnosky2011}. This loss of biodiversity is detrimental both to the 
ecosystems in which these species reside and to humanity, through the loss of 
ecosystem services such as sources of food, medicine, and employment. 
Furthermore, it can be argued that biodiversity is worth preserving for its own 
sake, although quantifying the intrinsic value of biodiverse ecosystems outside 
of potential anthropogenic uses can be challenging. 
True extinction events cannot (yet) be reversed, despite the valiant efforts of 
some to resurrect back the Wolly Mammoth \autocite{Piotrowska2018}). However, 
through conservation action, species that are extinct in the wild can be 
reintroduced; vulnerable or threatened species can be protected, and entire 
ecosystems can be protected. Conservation and re-introduciton of species have 
been happening across most continents for decades, with successful outcomes 
realised for a broad variety of taxanomic groups - from plants 
\autocite{Godefroid2011}, to freshwater fish \autocite{Cochran-Biederman2015}, 
to ferrets \autocite{Jachowski2011}. Unfortunately, conservation actions are
resource intensive and expensive, and conservationists are unable to protect 
every threatened or vulnerable species on the planet. This is compounded by a 
lack of comprehensive, up-to-date data on which species are threatened 
globally. These limitations, along with other practical challenges such as 
accessibility, force conservationists to select some species to focus on, 
meaning some species or entire ecosystems are left without any support.
\\ 
 There 
are many metrics by which conservationists evaluate species' worthiness of 
protection. Some focus on a species' "irreplaceabilitiy" - for example they 
focus on endemic species. Others focus on 
physiological or genetic 'uniqueness', unusual abilities, or species living in 
rare habitats \autocite{Brooks2006}. The problem with some of these approaches 
is that they can be skewed towards organisms that are charismatic (i.e. the 
Giant Panda), and miss species that are visually unremarkable or belonging to a 
non-charismatic taxa, but that might be 'diverse' or exciting for other reasons 
- such as being future source of medicinal chemicals, displaying interesting 
behaviour, or playing an irreplaceable role within an ecosystem 
\autocite{Clark2002}. 
\\

There is significant taxonomic and geographic bias 
reported in conservation research \autocite{Clark2002, Darwall2011, 
Watson2017}, which highlights the clear need for a method that avoids 
taxanomic bias, and can be applied widely to identify which species which 
require conservation 
prioritisation. \\ The 
'EDGE' metric seeks to solve this problem of biased prioritisation by 
calculating prioritisation lists of species using the evolutionary history 
represented by species - it's "Evolutionary Distinct" (ED) score combined with 
its level of global endangeredness (GE). A species' ED score is calculated 
using a phylogenetic 
tree, and the score represents the numbers of millions of years of evolutionary 
history that is within that species \autocite{Isaac2007}. Species that have 
speciated recently, or that have many recent 'cousin' species will have lower 
ED scores than species that have no close living relatives, and that speciated 
a long time ago.

	\label{IUCNcategories}
	
\end{wrapfigure}

The GE score of a species is calculated using the IUCN's 'Red 
List' assessment for that species \autocite{Isaac2007}, in which species are 
categorised according to how stable their populations are and how likely they 
are to become extinct \autocite{IUCN2000}. These categories are shown in Figure 
~\ref{IUCNcategories}. This metric was chosen for this 
study as it provides a mechanism to comprehensively assess species with family 
groups (or larger), and this study believes it will produce results that can be 
used to meaningfully influences the manner in which these species are 
considered. 

\subsection{Why fish?}

The group considered in this study are the \(Actinopterygii\), commonly 
known as the ray-finned fish. Actinopterygii are the largest class of 
vertebrate, with over 33,000 constituent species, with more species being 
described regularly \autocite{Fishbase}. For 
context, mammals are thought to have closer to 6,400 extant species 
\autocite{Mammal2020}; reptiles have 9,500 species 
\autocite{Pincheira-Donoso2013}
; and birds have around 18,000 \autocite{Barrowclough2016}. Unfortunately, the 
Actinopterygii are also proportionally 
the most understudied classes of the vertebrates. for example, just over 50\% 
of Actinopterygii are assessed in the IUCN Red List, 
compared with the 62-90\% of other classes, as laid out in 
Table ~\ref{ClassAssessment}. \\

	\begin{tabular}{lrrr}
	\textsc{Class} & \textsc{\# of Species} & \textsc{\# Assessed} & \textsc{\% 
	Assessed} \\	
	\hline
	\textsc{Actinopterygii}	& 33,000 & 17,955 & 54.4 \\
	\textsc{Mammalia} & 6,500 & 5850 & 90.0 \\
	\textsc{Aves} & 18,000 & 11,147 & 62.0 \\
	\textsc{Reptilia} & 9,400 & 7892 & 84.0 \\ 
	\multicolumn{4}{l}{\caption{Table ~\ref{ClassAssessment}: IUCN 
	Red List  assessments for vertebrate classes}} \\
	\multicolumn{4}{l}{ \autocite{Mammal2020, Pincheira-Donoso2013}} \\
	\multicolumn{4}{l}{ \autocite{Barrowclough2016, Fishbase}}
	\label{ClassAssessment}
	
\end{tabular}

The IUCN is not the only research body in which Actinopterygii are poorly 
represented. A 
quick search in WebofScience also demonstrates the lack of research into this 
class. When searching for topics that include the class names of the groups 
mentioned in Table ~\ref{ClassAssessment}, the results are as follows: 
Actinopterygii -2055; Mammalia - 8905; Reptilia - 6,030; Aves - 13,116.  This 
bias is acutely present in conservation science - a recent study by 
\cite{Watson2017} revealed that, of the vertebrate groups, fish had the highest 
imbalance between number of published merciless and number of described species 
(16\% and 50\% respectively).

Despite the lack of studies into Actinopterygii, many species of fish are 
acknowledged to be very important as a source of food and employment - through 
fishing, harvesting activities and tourism and entertainment. Fish consumption 
has been rising steadily for the past 6 decades, as highlighted clearly in 
Figure ~\ref{GlobalCatch}. 

\begin{wrapfigure}{r}{0.5\textwidth}
	
	\includegraphics[width=0.4\textwidth]{Images/GobalCatch.pdf}	
	\caption{Global catch of freshwater, demersal, pelagic and marine fish, \\
	\autocite{FAO2020} }  
	\label{GlobalCatch}
	
\end{wrapfigure}


Many people, especially in Europe and Northern 
America, are increasing the amount of fish in their diet - some to improve 
their health 
\autocite{Rimm2006}), and others to 
lessen their impact on the environment \autocite{Mary2020}. Younger generations 
are particularly aware of the impact their food choices have on the planet 
\autocite{Mary2020}, so it could be assumed that this trend of eating more fish 
is unlikely to change. This increased demand for fish (and fish-related 
products) has lead to an increase in aquaculture (farming fish) 
\autocite{Belton2018}. Wild-caught 
fish number are in decline due to stock exhaustion and 
populating collapse rather than a decrease in interest in wild caught fish 
\autocite{Tremblay2011, Belton2018}. 

Marine ecosystems in particular are under increasing pressure from human 
action. Globally, governments and scientific bodies have agreed that ecosystems 
need to be protected in order to protect the future of marine resources 
\autocite{MurakiGottlieb2018}. Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) are one form of 
protection - 
however the definition of these vary significantly from one location to 
another \autocite{Marinesque2012}. In general,  a MPA's success is evaluated by 
its effectiveness at conserving 'keystone' species, or their value to local 
fishing activities \autocite{Marinesque2012}. As discussed above, by 
considering only 'keystone' species, considerable ecosystem damage may occur 
un-measured, and diverse species may go un-protected. 

Given that many species of fish 
exist in both the marine and freshwater realms, and many more migrate around 
the globe, clear conservation prioritisation for fish will be crucial to ensure 
we do not fail to protect vulnerable and non-charismatic species. 


\subsection{X, Y  and Z}
subsection: why these fish in particular



[now to sum everything up] \\

It is clear that the Actinopterygii group is both under-studied and 
under-protected, despite their importance to human populations across the 
globe. This study is a first step in directly addressing this imbalance. Using 
the EDGE metric, we create conservation prioritisation lists for [X, Y and Z] 
and, along with geospatial analysis of their current habitats and threats, 
highlight methods through which vulnerable species could be protected. This 
study also provides a roadmap that will be useful for the creation of reports 
regarding other family groups within the Actiopterygii class.
